## The Problem
Caring for heart failure patients is a complex challenge due to the chronic and progressive nature of the disease. One major difficulty is monitoring symptoms and recognizing any signs of worsening, which is stressful but critical in heart disease patient care. As such, our team aims to create a streamlined tool to ease this process, aid in monitoring symptoms and providing ongoing support.  

## What it does
We present CardiacSOS, a revolutionizing emergency response vest designed to safeguard hearts! CardiacSOS is a wearable multi-sensor device for immediate and precise monitoring of a heart disease patient’s condition. Upon detecting any potential sign of deterioration, the vest interacts with the patient in real-time conversations using AI, relays important data to healthcare facilities and performs emergency responses accordingly, such as contacting an ambulance or providing preliminary medications. This system is the perfect solution that ensures emergencies are handled instantly and effectively, improving the patient experience in healthcare. 

## How we built it
We used several technologies to build the system, integrating both software and hardware aspects. For detection of patient conditions, we used arduinos, noise, temperature and humidity sensors, ECG monitor and a stepper motor. Streamlit was used for data visualization. We then integrated voice recognition and text to audio python libraries, enabling conversation between the patient and AI. The frontend interface was built using Java, HTML, C++ and Django. 

## What we are proud of
We are very proud of how we were able to complete such a comprehensive system within 24 hours. This hackathon challenged us to learn things we’ve never been exposed to before, such as HTML and Django. In addition, we overcame challenges of connecting everything together into a coherent streamlined process. We are super proud of what we achieved and we hope you enjoyed learning about CardiacSOS!
